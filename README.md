# DevBot

DevBot is a versatile tool designed to assist developers in their daily tasks. It leverages AI to provide intelligent responses and automate various operations.

## Features

- **Chat Mode**: Engage in a conversational interface where you can ask questions or provide prompts, and DevBot will respond accordingly.
- **Prompt Mode**: Use the `--prompt` or `-p` flag to provide a prompt directly from the command line.
- **Prompt File Mode**: Use the `--prompt_file` or `-pf` flag to provide a file containing the prompt.
- **Output to File**: Use the `--output` or `-o` flag to save the AI's response to a file instead of displaying it in the terminal.
- **Reset**: Use the `reset` command during chat mode to reset the AI's context.
- **Exit**: Use the `exit` command to end the chat session.
